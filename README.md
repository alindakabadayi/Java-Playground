# Java-Playground

A repository containing sample projects and code snippets created during my Java programming language learning journey.

## Development Environment

- **Java Version:** JDK 22
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA

## Content

This repository contains examples covering different levels and features of the Java programming language:

### [1-Basics](./1-Basics/README.md)
Examples covering basic Java structures, data types, operators, conditional statements, and loops.

### 2-OOP
Examples covering object-oriented programming principles (in preparation).


## About the Projects

Each folder contains mini-projects that demonstrate specific Java concepts or features. Each project folder comes with its own README.md file providing information about the project's purpose and how to run it.

## How to Run

All projects are developed with JDK 22 and tested in the IntelliJ IDEA environment.

### Running with IntelliJ IDEA
1. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA
2. Find the relevant `Main.java` file
3. Right-click and select "Run 'Main.main()'"

### Running from Command Line
Each project folder typically contains a `src` directory with the main application code. To run the projects:

1. Navigate to the relevant project folder
2. Compile the `Main.java` file with Java compiler:
   ```bash
   javac --release 22 src/Main.java
   ```
3. Run the compiled class:
   ```bash
   java -cp src Main
   ```
