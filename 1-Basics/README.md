# Java Basic Concepts and Examples

This section contains examples covering the basic concepts and features of the Java programming language. It explains fundamental structures with clear examples for programming beginners.

## Development Environment

- **Java Version:** JDK 22
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA

## Content

### 1. [Start](./Start)
First "Hello World" application demonstrating the basic structure of Java.

### 2. [Variables and Data Types](./Degiskenler_Veritipleri)
Basic data types, variables, and mathematical operations in Java. This example includes:
- Basic mathematical operators
- Increment and decrement operators
- Using the Math class
- Calculating circle area and circumference
- Triangle area calculation (Heron's formula)
- Temperature conversion
- Interest calculation

### 3. [Conditional Statements](./KosulluDurumlar)
Examples of If-else structures and Switch-case usage:
- Age-based driving permission control
- Category-based evaluation with Switch-case
- Basic calculator class with simple calculator
- FindMaxMin class for finding the largest and smallest numbers

### 4. [Loops](./Donguler)
For, while, and do-while loop structures and usage examples.

### 5. [Armstrong Number Check](./ArmstrongSayiKontrolu)
An Armstrong number is a number where the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits equals the number itself. This project is a Java application that checks whether a number is an Armstrong number.

### 6. [ATM Project](./ATMProject)
A simple bank ATM simulation project. A console application where users can check account balance, deposit, and withdraw money.

### 7. [Multiplication Table](./CarpimTablosu)
A program that creates a multiplication table for a user-specified number.

### 8. [User Login](./UserLogin)
A simple user login verification application.

### 9. [Interest Calculator](./InterestCalculator)
A Java application that calculates simple interest based on the principal amount, interest rate, and time period entered by the user. It displays the total amount for each year using the compound interest method.

## Running the Projects

All examples are developed with JDK 22 and tested with IntelliJ IDEA.

### Running with IntelliJ IDEA
1. Open the project folder in IntelliJ IDEA
2. Find the relevant class (usually Main.java)
3. Right-click and select "Run"

### Running from Command Line
You can run the `Main.java` file in the `src` directory of each project folder:

```bash
javac --release 22 Main.java  # To compile the code
java Main                      # To run the compiled code
```
